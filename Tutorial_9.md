# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

# Substrate Part II
In Part 1 we compiled and ran a substrate backend node (on our local machine) and connected it to the front end from Polkadot. The node was called kitchen-node and when running it sat idle waiting for something to happen. This idle-ness was due to the type of consensus mechanism it was running: instant seal. The idea is that when there is something new to report the runtime calls the consensus module and it is processed. Instant seal wakes up from idle and the transaction is committed instantly. Easy.

Lets look at a more traditional consensus mechanism: Proof of Work. A key difference here is that the consensus mechanism runs *independently* of the activity (in the runtime). This means that blocks will be mined and appended regardless of transaction activity. From the users point of view a transaction may have to wait in a queue and you may not know when it will be processed, or if at all. A consequence of interest is the possibility of mining empty blocks.
> Q✋: What are the implications of mining empty blocks?

## Basic-PoW
A basic [proof of work node](https://substrate.dev/recipes/basic-pow.html) comes prepackaged with the recipes cookbook. This node uses `sha3pow::MinimalSha3Algorithm` a family of [secure hashing algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) (generation three). The algo is minimal because its just to get you started. When using a PoW there must be difficulty function as well as a validator function. More details are [here](https://substrate.dev/recipes/sha3-pow-consensus.html) and you can see that it is using `256` bits for the hashing length:

```
impl<B: BlockT<Hash = H256>> PowAlgorithm<B> for MinimalSha3Algorithm {
    type Difficulty = U256;
```

## run it
In the `\nodes` folder there are four different nodes. Build the node called `basic-pow`:\
`$ cargo build --bin kitchen-node --release`

Run the compiled binary, here using development `--dev` mode and a temporary storage directory `--tmp`):\
`$ cargo run --bin kitchen-node -- --dev --tmp`

Successful build & run will yield terminal output:

Check back on the terminal output to see that blocks have been mining away! Note that the `best` is incrementing, but the `finalized` is staying at `#0`. More on this in a jiffy. Compare the hashes to see that they're unique. Check the parent_hashes.

## Process a transaction
Head to [polkadot.js.org/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/) to see a live interface to the Polkadot blockchain and connect to your local node (e.g.: `Prometheus server started at 127.0.0.1:9615` from above output). Your block explorer should show you all the recent blocks. This is a different from last time when we only saw blocks once some activity was processed by the instant seal consensus method.

Click Accounts and send some funds. A notification will let you know the transaction is ready. A further notification will appear when the block is mined.

> Q✋: Do all blocks occur at regular intervals? Why or why not?

Once mined check out some details. Note event count, extrinsic count, & weight.

## RandomnessDemo
Lets access a random number. There is a pallet called `randomness collective flip` that will use some part of the previous block's hashes to generate a seed value. This seed is then influenced by a user-dertermined nonce to produce a random result when this extrinsic is called. The seed is only generated once per block.

```
let random_seed = T::RandomnessSource::random_seed();
let random_result = T::RandomnessSource::random(&subject);
```

Go to the Developer tab -> Extrinsics. Select `randomnessDemo` -> `consumeRandomness()`. Sign and submit the transaction.

The random function was called in block 35 and so the seed depends on block 34.

> Q✋: Why would we want to access a random number?

## What about Validators?
Aura and Babe are the names of consensus modules that query the runtime for the set of validators that can be used for block production. As only certain nodes have validator status, they are special.

## Finalization

# Footnotes
> SHA-3 uses a completely different underlying [recipe](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14356526/whats-the-difference-between-the-hash-algorithms-sha-2-and-sha-3) to scramble the bits and was chosen for its dissimilarity to SHA-2 which is famous for its SHA-256 used in Bitcoin.
