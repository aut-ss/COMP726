# Tutorial 5: Its time to build!

For the next few weeks we're going to look at a common system for writing smart contracts (snippets of code) that can be deployed to and interact with Ethereum. 

*Note:* Most students want to build an app that interacts with a blockchain and this is what learning some solidity can help you with. You are not required to use Solidiy/Ethereum for your project; see [below]() for a list of some alternatives. This is simply informative to give you an idea of whats possible. You are encouraged to use whatever tech/IDE/language/system that interests you. Some students are interested in other aspects of blockchains (not SC-based apps) and that is great too! 

## Solidity
Solidity is a programming language developed specifically to create smart contracts to be executed by the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). It looks a lot like javascript. The benefit of learning some solidity is that it is widely used, has been around for a long time (relative to other SC languages) and so has support libraries.

## Remix
Head to [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to get started. We'll be going through the LEARNETH tutorials.![LearnEth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39792005/128951882-1708100a-927e-48a9-8e51-947c37d3f4f2.PNG)


## Developed Learning Tools
Some links that may be helpful:
- [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/learning-tools/) developer learning tools
- [Eth.Build](https://eth.build/) has a drag and drop interface
- [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/solidity) is a very popular game to help you learn
