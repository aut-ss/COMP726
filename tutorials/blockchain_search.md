## Exercises
In pairs with your neighbor have a look at some of the tokens/blockchains that are listed. Select a few chains to start researching deeper. Use the following to guide your investigation:
* What 'type' of blockchain is it? What does that mean?
* What can it do? Would you want to use it?
* Does it have a token? Why does it have a token?

Select one that interests you and prepare to give a brief report to the class on the blockchain you have selected. Answer the following questions:
1. What is the consensus mechanism?
2. What is an app that runs on the chain?
3. What sets it apart from other chains?

The goal of the exercise to expose you to some of the blockchains and resources available. Through the class reporting and discussion you will be introduced to blockchain specific language and terminology that will be explored in more detail throughout the semester. You do not have to make any decisions about your project at this stage.
