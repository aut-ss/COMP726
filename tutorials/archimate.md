# ArchiMate
This tutorial provides an introduction to [ArchiMate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArchiMate), a system architecture modelling language that provides the ability to quickly visualise system requirements and components. ArchiMate can be used with any other modelling language such as UML, BPMN, etc. As you development your research project, you are expected to provide clear evidence of the design process and ArchiMate is useful for that.

### Example
Jeff found this from a Google image search as an example encorporating blockchain. We will work through a specific use-case in tutorial.

* There are also some sample files on [Canvas](https://canvas.aut.ac.nz/courses/8343/modules/items/429851)

### In-Browser Alternatives
* [Visual Paradigm Online](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/app/diagrams/#diagram:proj=0&type=ArchiMateDiagram&width=11&height=8.5&unit=inch) hsa a browser tool to start modelling immediately--no sign up. The export files are watermarked.
* [Creately](https://app.creately.com/) has a demo version (put in any email address) or a free-tier that requires signup 

### Desktop Alternatives
* [Microsoft Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software) *may* be installed in your lab PC. I'm not sure if the student Office subscription includes it.
