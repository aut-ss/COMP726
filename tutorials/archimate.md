# ArchiMate
This tutorial provides an introduction to [ArchiMate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArchiMate), a system architecture modelling language that provides the ability to quickly visualise system requirements and components. ArchiMate can be used with any other modelling language such as UML, BPMN, etc. As you development your research project, you are expected to provide clear evidence of the design process and ArchiMate is useful for that.
