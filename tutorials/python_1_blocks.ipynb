Alternatively this source file can be downloaded and run locally with [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/) or directly with Jupyter (Lab|Notebook). Jupyter and Anaconda should be installed in all AUT engineering and computer science labs. I recommend using a web-interface for portability.\n\nThe benefit of using Jupyter is that code snippets can be run live (Python is running in the background).\n\nThe version on Github is static; markdown is rendered but code cannot be executed. All code can be copied and pasted into your favourite text editor or IDE and *should* run with Python 3.x ;)\n\nYou are encouraged to use any programming language you feel comfortable with, this is simply an example using Python (and Jupyter is designed for Python demonstrations).\n\n---",
